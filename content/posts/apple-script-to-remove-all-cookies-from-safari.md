Just copy and paste this into  Script Editor.app. Then save this as application. Named it e.g: `CleanCookies.app`. Move this app to `~/Application` or `/Applications`. And all you need is to call from Spotlight aaaand you are done. Enjoy you web browser from tracking cookies.

```AppleScript
tell application "Safari"
    activate
    repeat until frontmost is true
    end repeat
    tell application "System Events" to tell process "Safari"
        tell application "System Events" to keystroke "," using command down
        delay 1.0E-3
        tell window 1
            click button "Privacy" of toolbar 1
            click button "Manage Website Dataâ€¦" of group 1 of group 1
            delay 1
            tell sheet 1
                if exists row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 then
                    click button "Remove All"
                    tell application "System Events" to key code 36 #return
                end if
                click button "Done"
                click button 1 of window 1
            end tell
            close
        end tell

    end tell
end tell
```

_Important note:_

for directory `/Applications` you need admin rights  thanks to SIP. This can be done **only** via gui.
