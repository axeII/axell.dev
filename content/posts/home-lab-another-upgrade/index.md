## Upgrade

In the most recent upgrade for my homelab, I began by renovating the front panel to boost ease of use and overall aesthetics. The cornerstone of this update, however, was substituting the DAS (Direct Attached Storage) disk array with a brand-new server, dual-purposed as a NAS (Network Attached Storage). This transformation is sure to increase storage capacity, improve data management and ultimately enhance the overall efficiency of my homelab.
