I started my journey at kiwi.com as an intern. I was part of the platform team that managed GitLab and CI/CD for the entire organization. We worked close with security and DevOps teams. I had to take a break to finish my master degree in IT (and Economics). After graduation I started as backend python engineer, but after some time I returned to DevOps.

I really enjoy working with tools like k8s but sometimes it's pain ðŸ¤£. I am also fan of security and from time to time I do CTF. In my free time o work on my [home-lab project](https://github.com/axeII/home-ops) where I perform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices.

Currently I work for company KM as Devops engineer. I am also member of Cyber security as a Ambassador there actively contributing to the safeguarding of our digital ecosystem and work very close with Security engenieers.
