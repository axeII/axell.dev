Started as an intern managing GitLab and CI/CD at Kiwi.com. Returned to my career after completing a master's degree at university. Worked as a Python engineer, but after a few years, found my way back to DevOps.

Currently a DevOps engineer at KM company, handling cloud, Git pipelines, and security. Enjoy working with Kubernetes (although it can be challenging sometimes ðŸ¤£). Maintain a home lab project for IaC and GitOps practice and occasionally break the home networkðŸš¨.
