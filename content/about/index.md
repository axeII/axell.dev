Started as an intern managing GitLab and CI/CD at Kiwi.com. Returned to my career after completing a master's degree at university. Worked as a Python engineer, but after a few years, found my way back to DevOps.

Currently a DevOps engineer at Capital Markets Gateway company, handling kubernetes clusters (AKS), infrastrastructure (terraform) and pipelines (Github). Enjoy working with Kubernetes. In my free time I maintain project called HomeOps (IaC and GitOps practice) and occasionally break network at home ðŸ˜±.
